Simple Containerfiles/Dockerfiles to create a UBI image for evaluating package requests

* The ubi8 image is automatically built and stored at quay.io/fatherlinux/ubi8-priorities
* The ubi7 image must be built yourself on a subscribed RHEL 7 system since the yum-pluin-priorities package is part of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux agreement
